title: Research Talk at Tongji University
---

Thanks to Dr. Peng Qi, I was invited to deliver a research talk at [Tongji University](http://www.tongji.edu.cn/english/), Shanghai last week. Augmented Reality is a generally new area for researchers in China. The response from the students of Tongji was quite rewarding for me.
