<br>

I am a Ph.D student at the Department of Computer Science at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/). My research focuses are **Augmented Reality** and **Robotics**, with emphasis on both scientific and engineering aspects. My supervisors are [Dr. Peter Kazanzides](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/faculty/peter-kazanzides/) and [Dr. Nassir Navab](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/faculty/nassir-navab/). Prior to my Ph.D studies, I received B.E. at [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), China.
